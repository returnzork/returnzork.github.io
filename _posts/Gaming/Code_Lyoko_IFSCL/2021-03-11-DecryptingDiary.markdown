This guide has been written for version 4.1.3 [build 1169]

<br />

Start by starting a new mission, and getting all of the Lyoko Warriors to a way tower (tower 1 or tower 10)

<br />

Next you need to open the energy transmission window, with TRANSM

Then you need to transmit power to that way tower to activate it for your control. To do that, take a look at what tower you are in. In my case, I am in the Mountain Sector at tower 1. <br />
The command to run is TRANSM.TO.{sector}.{tower}<br />
Which for Mountain Sector, Tower 1, the command is: TRANSM.TO.MOUNTAIN.1

<br />

Now that you have selected the tower to use, you will need to activate the tower, and then break it's inhibitors.

Start by activating the tower with TRANSM.EXE <br />
- This will open the superscan window to that tower you just activated<br />

And to break the tower's inhibitors, you will need to first open the super scan inhibitor window with SUPERSCAN.INHIB and then follow that with the inhibitor breaking program: CRYPTO and then CRYPTO.INHIB <br />

Now that the tower is activated, and the inhibitors are broken, we can start the decryption of Franz Hopper's diary. <br />
Send Aelita into the way tower on the second floor, and tell her to "Decrypt Diary". Two new windows will appear, one being the DIARYF program, and the other being the diary decryptor.

This process will take a few minutes, so make sure you have the other Lyoko Warriors outside the tower ready to defend it, as XANA will be sending monsters to destroy the tower. <br />
Shortly after starting the diary decryption, XANA will also attempt to take over the tower.

In order to prevent XANA from successfully taking over the tower and stopping the decryption, you will need to transfer additional power to the tower. <br />

If you still have the TRANSM window open, all you need to do is run TRANSM.EXE again (a couple times for good measure). This will take energy away from the super computer for other programs such as the overvehicles though. Every time that TRANSM.EXE gets ran again, an additional 1000 points will be given to the tower.
- If you closed the TRANSM window, you will need to reopen it with TRANSM, and then transfer power to the tower with TRANSM.TO.{sector}.{tower}, and finish with TRANSM.EXE
<br />

As you can see, after transferring more power to the tower, I ended up with 3000 power, which brought the supercomputer down to only 250 remaining.

If in the scenario settings you set that Franz Hopper was still alive, at about 80% of the decryption, he will take over the tower and return the power back to the supercomputer.

Then after the decryption process completes, we have access to Franz Hopper's diary. This window can be opened with the DIARYF command at any time.
